SN to teach and instruct patient/PCG on strategies to prevent urinary tract infections. SN to instruct patient not to hold urge to urinate and to drink plenty of plain water daily.

	GOAL FOR UTI –
By the end of certification period, patient will be without S&S of UTI (pain, foul odor, cloudy or bloody-tinged urine and fever) and dehydration. Patient will maintain normal urinary patterns without any complications. Patient/PCG will be able to verbalize and understand strategies on prevention of UTIs.

CVA –

SN to focus assessment of critical indicators of CVA such as numbness or loss of sensation; weakness or paralysis of part or one side of the body; aphasia; headache; neck stiffness and rigidity; vomiting; seizures; syncope; visual disturbances such as diplopia, hemianopia, tinnitus, changes in mentation, bowel/bladder incontinence. SN to teach patient methods for turning and moving, using stronger extremity to move weaker extremity and encourage active/passive ROM to improve muscle tone. SN to instruct on importance of taking rest periods in between activities, demonstrate proper body alignment and proper positioning to prevent fall/injury.

Dysphasia
SN to assess and observe degree of patient's dysphasia and assist patient in establishing means of communication that patient would feel more at ease to express his needs or any questions.	GOAL

Goals FOR CVA –

By the end of episode, patient/PCG will demonstrate understanding of the nature of CVA. Patient will have stable or improving sensorimotor functioning. Patient will have normal bowel pattern, and demonstrate proficiency with assistive device/techniques in ambulating/transferring. Patient will be able to demonstrate ability to use adaptive/ambulatory devices for successful completion of ADLs. Patient/PCG will demonstrate/verbalize compliance with prescribed diet and medication regimen. Patient/PCG will verbalize understanding of disease process; identify critical S&S of potential complications and exacerbation, medication management, action, side effects and adverse reactions.


Depression

SN to observe/instruct in s/s of depression/anxiety.  SN to assess for appetite changes and sleep pattern.  SN to instruct on medication compliance, getting regular exercise and maintaining regular sleep pattern.

	Goals – Depression
Patient will be compliant with prescribed medications, get adequate sleep, remain physically active and report s/s of exacerbation to SN/MD.

Constipation

SN to instruct about measures to avoid constipation by increasing dietary fiber and fluid intake, increased activity within  the limitations of functional ability.

	Goals – Constipation

	Patient will restore normal bowel elimination and will verbalize prescribed measures to establish and maintain good bowel habits.

Physical Therapy (PT):
Physical Therapist to assess and evaluate level of pain and instruct about prescribed measures of pain management. PT to observe and evaluate patient's level of tolerance to perform physical activities.

Physical Therapist to evaluate and appropriately treat for active and passive range of motion and strengthening exercises, upgrade balance coordination and transfer. Physical Therapist to provide gait training and to establish a home exercise program.
Physical Therapist to instruct patient/PCG about graded home exercise program to preserve joint function and avoid deformities, to pace daily activities and balance with rest periods, to avoid overexertion and prolonged immobility. PT to observe and instruct patient/PCG about joint protection technique measures to rest and reduce stress on joints. PT to instruct patient on proper body positioning and good body mechanics.

Patient specific DX:  PT  to instruct patient/PCG on the nature of  (write here patient specific P.T. Problems, e.g. Sciatica)  progression, prevention, treatment and goals of management.  

Add this if patient has joint pains, arthritis, or gout:  PT to assess for S&S of joint pains of legs such as joint stiffness, swelling, pain which worsens with activities and is not relieved with rest, progressive loss in ROM, crepitation, increasing weakness, fatigue and increasing morning stiffness.
